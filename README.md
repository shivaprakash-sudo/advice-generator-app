## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwindcss
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript Frontend library

### What I learned

I still haven't got used to Tailwindcss yet, but this was a fun and frustrating project, because I had to spend most of the time reading Tailwindcss documentationðŸ˜‚.

### Continued development

After doing this project, I feel more confident with Tailwindcss and React, and I want to build more projects using these technologies.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Reading documentation is always good, but boring.
